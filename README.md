# Automated-Coffee-Ordering-System
This code implements an interactive coffee ordering system that allows users to select drinks, manages resources, processes payments, and prepares the chosen coffee drink.
# What I have learned
Through this project, I have learned how to create a coffee ordering system using Python. I have gained knowledge in working with classes and modules, managing resources such as ingredients and money, handling user input, and generating reports. Additionally, I have developed skills in implementing conditional statements, looping, and integrating different components to create a functional application.
